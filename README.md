Basic Bootstrap Website

For this assignment I decided to mockup a few pages of what a browser-based music streaming service might look like, incorporating and old logo design of mine for "Agave Audio"

1.	Create a new website using HTML and Bootstrap. The website must include the following:
a.	A Bootstrap navbar
b.	A Bootstrap styled table
c.	A Bootstrap styled form
d.	At least 2 pages
e.	Bootstrap grid used throughout to format elements
i.	Elements should stack vertically when the window is small
